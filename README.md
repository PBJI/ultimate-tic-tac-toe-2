# bot_for_uttt

Bots that can take in a game state in UTTT and generate the best possible counter move.

This is a repository to test various bots for UTTT, so there would be multiple files but
the input and output of these files will remain consistent.

The language and platform we will use would be node.js because of my personal preference.

Here is the list of bots that are implemented:
minimax.js

Inputs:
```
Arr[3][3][3][3] = [ [ [ [],[],[] ], [ [],[],[] ], [ [],[],[] ] ], [...], [...], [...] ]
```

Output:
```
Arr [4] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]
```
